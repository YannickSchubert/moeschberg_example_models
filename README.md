# Moeschberg example models

This is the result of subgroup "conceptual prototype/model implementation/user stories" from Sentier.dev MÃ¶schberg Mini Hackathon in June 2024. See more details at:
https://github.com/sentier-dev/sentier.dev/discussions/23

## Code Example: wind turbine model

In sentier_models/ we provided an example where a user 
can query the Wind-Turbine-Design model (see [windsch](https://github.com/romainsacchi/windisch)). Our minimalistic orchestrator will look-up the user-provided label (e.g. "wind turbines") in the sentier-glossary. Based on the URI of this glossary-item it will search through implemented models (in this case only the Wind-turbine-design-model) and tries to find a match based on the available outputs of the models. The models themselves are defined as pydantic classes that have a set of meta-parameters as well as inputs, outputs and a run-method. The inputs and outputs are dictionaries of Products where each Product can have a dict of additional Attributes (see also the figma-diagram below). To execute install the dependencies and execute the example you can run

```sh
poetry install
poetry run python -m sentier_models
```

# Mapping
## Design choices / objectives
The objective for mapping is to try and match terms for processes to the latest version (at the time of writing) [European Commission Combined Nomenclature ontology](https://showvoc.op.europa.eu/#/datasets/ESTAT_Combined_Nomenclature,_2024_%28CN_2024%29/data).

The mapping produced can be found in `wind_turbine_data/inputs_iris_map.csv`. The schema for the mapping is to be found in `schema_mapping.md`

> The Combined Nomenclature (CN) is a tool for classifying goods, set up to meet the requirements both of the Common Customs Tariff and of the EU's external trade statistics. The CN is also used in intra-EU trade statistics.
*Source: https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/customs-4/calculation-customs-duties/customs-tariff/combined-nomenclature_en*

This tends to only cover physical tangible entities, and tends to exclude non-tangible entities as well as services, that can have significance for environmental or socia Life Cycle Assessment.

Important concepts or entities for environmental life cycle assessment that cannot be expressed with the EU Combined Nomenclature include:
- land transformation 
- electricity generation, transformation or transmission
- services or activities, like welding

This is not an exhaustive list and (hopefully) subject to change
